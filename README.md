## Hi, I am Diego del Castillo Berges!

I am systems neuroscience researcher working at the Molecular Phisiology of the Synapse group (http://molecular-synapse.org/) at the Institut de Recerca Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain; https://www.recercasantpau.cat/).
I study the molecular composition of synapses and how it changes over time in both physiology and disease, with a focus on neurodevelopmental disorders. I am particularly interested in understanding how sleep and circadian rhythms influence synaptic function.
Currently, my work combines EEG analysis, computational modeling, and molecular data to link neural dynamics with underlying molecular changes.

### Interests
- Neuroscience
- Proteomics
- Data Analysis
- Synaptic Plasticity
- Sleep and Circadian Rhythms
- Neurodevelopmental Disorders
